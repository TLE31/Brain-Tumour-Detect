Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Hybrid Inception-ResNet Based UNet Architecture
 • Developed Inception-ResUNet architecture for brain tumor segmentation, achieving a significant improvement over
 traditional UNet models.
 • Implemented advanced deep learning techniques using Python, such as inception modules and skip connections, to
 optimize brain tumor segmentation with superior accuracy.
 • Enhanced segmentation accuracy with Mean IoU of 0.9107 and Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8803 on BRATS 2020
 dataset
